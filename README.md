It is a  faster and more flexible file browser for Linux. It offers rich capabilities such as case sensitivity, regular expression-based search, search by selecting multiple file types, control of the algorithm's depth, and more. Also, it allows the choice of custom files not to be taken into account in the search process to improve the search speed.

## Stack selected and architecture

It was made using the [Electron framework](https://www.electronjs.org/). The UI was created with [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) version 18, using the new concurrency capabilities in this new release. [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) library was used as the global state feature.

For the features related to file search and shell command execution, [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) was used.The project is in the process of getting started, my goal is to achieve the capabilities of the windows "everything" software.
In this version we are not using indexing. But we are exploiting the multitasking capabilities offered by Nodejs to try to perform a search in the file tree as fast as possible. I use [child_process](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v17.x/api/child_process.html), [spawn](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v17.x/api/child_process.html#child_processspawncommand-args-options), [fork](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v17.x/api/child_process.html#child_processforkmodulepath-args-options), and [worker_threads](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v17.x/api/worker_threads.html).

### Software Architecture

Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. By embedding Chromium and Node.js into its binary, Electron allows you to maintain one JavaScript codebase and create cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux — no native development experience required.
It has two main processes, IcpMain and IcpRender. IcpMain is a node base environment where all Nodejs functionalities such as path, fs, EventEmitter, child_process, worker_threads, etc. can be accessed.
IcpRender is in charge of the render ui.

I've implemented a multi threading BFS for search in the File System Tree.
